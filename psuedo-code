when the mouse hovers over the grid, it changes color

the current grid and sends a popup asking how many squares

- hover effect
    for each div in container, add a listen event for
    hover that adds a class (wes boss video) to that div
    the class will change the color

    other option is to inline style it which might
    make the rgb work
